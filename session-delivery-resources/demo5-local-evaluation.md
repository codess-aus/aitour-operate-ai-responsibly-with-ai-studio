# Demo 5 - Local Evaluation

The goal of this demo is to demonstrate the ability to run an evaluation locally and view the results in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

## Demo delivery tips

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended, if delivered live, to pre-run the evaluation before you get on stage. The evaluation can take up to 5-30 mins. A video recording with no audio has been provided if you would prefer to speak over a prerecorded and edited version for speed.
