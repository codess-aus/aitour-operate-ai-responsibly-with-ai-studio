# Demo 2 - Evaluate Models with Your Own Data

The goal of this demo is to demonstrate the ability to evaluate models using your own data within the Azure AI Foundry portal.

## Demo delivery tips

### Prior to delivery

Ensure that the sample is already deployed and that you have model deployments within the project.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended, if delivered live, to pre-run the evaluation before you get on stage. The evaluation can take up to 10 mins. A video recording with no audio has been provided if you would prefer to speak over a prerecorded and edited version for speed.

### During delivery

1. Go through the process of creating a new evaluation - select **Model and prompt**.
1. Select **Use existing dataset** given that the data for the Creative Writer sample is already available given the prior sample deployment. You can discuss the other options available such as importing a formatted .csv file (possible with **Add your dataset**).
1. Review and discuss the evaluation results for the given metrics.
