# Demo 0 - Creative Writing Agent

The goal of this demo is to demonstrate the Contoso Creative Writer app, which uses AI agents driven by Azure OpenAI to generate well-researched, product-specific articles. This demo will walk through the app's functionality, from entering user instructions to following the agent workflow, and show how the app leverages different AI agents to deliver a refined, informative article.
